        <strong>Sonnet 18</strong> is perhaps the most famous, and begins like this:

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?<br>
          Thou art more lovely and more temperate.<br>
          Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,<br>
          And summer's lease hath all too short a date.

      <h1>Learn Enough Story</h1>
        <p>
          Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach
          <em>technical sophistication</em>, the seemingly magical ability to take
          command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. 
          This includes everything from command lines and coding to guessing keyboard shortcuts,
          Googling error messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing.
          We believe there are <strong>at least a billion people</strong> who can benefit from
          learning technical sophistication, probably more.
